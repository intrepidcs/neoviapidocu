# WaitForRxMessagesWithTimeOut Method - intrepidcs API

This method is used to wait a specified amount of time for received messages from the neoVI hardware.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cpp" label="C/C++ Declare" default>

```cpp
int _stdcall icsneoWaitForRxMessagesWithTimeOut(void * hObject, unsigned int iTimeOut);
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="vbnet" label="Visual Basic .NET Declare">

```vbnet
Public Declare Function icsneoWaitForRxMessagesWithTimeOut Lib “icsneo40.dll” (ByVal hObject As IntPtr, ByVal iTimeOut As UInt32) As Int32
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="c#" label="C# Declare">

```csharp
[DllImport(“icsneo40.dll”)] public static extern Int32 icsneoWaitForRxMessagesWithTimeOut(IntPtr hObject, UInt32 iTimeOut);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Parameters**

hObject

\[in] Specifies the driver object created by [OpenNeoDevice](../basic-functions-overview-intrepidcs-api/openneodevice-method-intrepidcs-api.md).

iTimeOut

\[in] Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that the function will wait for a received message before returning.

**Return Values**

0 if no message was received during the wait period. 1 if a message was received. -1 will be returned if there is an error condition. [GetLastAPIError](../error-functions-overview-intrepidcs-api/getlastapierror-method-intrepidcs-api.md) must be called to obtain the specific error. The errors that can be generated by this function are:

NEOVI\_ERROR\_DLL\_NEOVI\_NO\_RESPONSE = 75

**Remarks**

This function allows an application to avoid ‘polling’ for received messages. It will return as soon as a message is received or when the timeout specified has been reached.

### **Examples**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cpp" label="C/C++ Declare" default>

```cpp
void * hObject = 0; // holds a handle to the neoVI object
icsSpyMessage stMessages[19999]; // holds the received messages
int iResult;
int iNumberOfErrors;
int iNumberOfMessages;
unsigned int iTimeOut = 5; //milliseconds
bool bDone = false;

while(!bDone)
{
    iResult = icsneoWaitForRxMessagesWithTimeOut(hObject, iTimeOut);

    if(iResult == 0)
        continue; //no messages received

    iResult = icsneoGetMessages(hObject,stMessages,&iNumberOfMessages,&iNumberOfErrors);

    if(iResult == 0)
        MessageBox(hWnd,TEXT("Problem Reading Messages"),TEXT("neoVI Example"),0);
    else
        MessageBox(hWnd, TEXT("Messages Read Successfully"),TEXT("neoVI Example"),0);
}

return 0;
